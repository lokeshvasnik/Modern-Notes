# Modern NotesðŸ”¥

I have created this web application, called Modern Notes, as an alternative to Memonotepad.

 Modern Notes is built using the MERN stack and features a sleek user interface.

 I decided to create this application because I felt that the user interface of Memonotepad could be improved.
